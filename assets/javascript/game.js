/*Here's me pseudocoding the rest of my work. Sorry I was unable to complete it the way I had envisioned it.
The object of this game is to guess the name of famous artists.
At the start of the game:
  -an art piece/painting created by the artist would be displayed on the left side
  -on the right side would be blanks that had the same amount of characters that belonged to the artist's name.
  1. In order to do that, I planned on creating an array that matched the artist name and artist painting. That is 
    why artistNameArray is created. 
    -The values from the array would randomly be generated by Math.random from artistNameArray.length resulting into guessWord. 
    -Math.floor was added because it is used to round the random length to a whole number.
  2. Once guessWord is generated, a for loop is used to create the amount of blanks that are needed to match
    the same amount of characters from guessWord.
    -AppendChild was used because I wanted to put blank into the empty div word-blanks.
  3. Then I would use a function where the player can press any key letter to guess. 
    -The player would only have 15 tries to play.
    -Once those 15 tries are up, the player will lose if the artist name is not guessed.
    -While playing, each letter that is pressed will be displayed.
    -If the correct letter is pressed, then it will fill in the blanks.
    -If the incorrect letter is pressed, it will show up in the Letters Guessed section.
  
  Other notes: I planned on using bootstrap to tidy up the site and planned on using cards to display the images of their paintings.
